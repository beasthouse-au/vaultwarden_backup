Backs up vaultwarden files and directories to `tar.xz` archives automatically. `tar.xz` archives can be opened using data compression programs like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) and [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/).

Files and directories that are backed up:
- db.sqlite3
- config.json
- rsa_key.der
- rsa_key.pem
- rsa_key.pub.der
- /attachments
- /sends

## Usage

#### Automatic Backups
Refer to the `docker-compose` section below. By default, backing up is automatic.

#### Manual Backups
Pass `manual` to `docker run` or `docker-compose` as a `command`.

## docker-compose
```
services:
  # vaultwarden configuration here if you want share the docuker-compose file
  backup:
    image: jmqm/vaultwarden_backup:latest
    network_mode: none
    volumes:
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro     # Container uses date from host
      - /vaultwarden_data_directory:/data:ro # The Vaultwarden data directory to backup
      - /backup_directory:/backups           # Directory to save the backups
    environment:
      - CRON_TIME=0 */24 * * *               # Runs at every day 00:00
      - DELETE_AFTER=30                      # Days to delete
```

## Volumes _(permissions required)_
`/data` _(read)_- Vaultwarden's `/data` directory. Recommend setting mount as read-only.

`/backups` _(write)_ - Where to store backups to.
